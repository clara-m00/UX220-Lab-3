        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Although this movie is not the most recent movie I have seen lately, I personally think it is one of the
            best movies Iâ€™ve seen in a long time, and definitely one of my personal favourites. One of the main themes
            of the movie is generational trauma, and the relationship between the main character (Evelyn, a mother who
            immigrated to America from China), her husband (Waymond), and her daughter (Joy). This movie hit home for me
            as I have immigrant parents as well, and this movie really touches on the complicated relationship between
            an immigrant mother and her daughter who is a second generation immigrant. It was very relatable and
            emotional to see this kind of relationship in a movie. </p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Another theme of this movie is the idea of Nihilism, which is the belief that life is meaningless. As
            someone who struggles with mental health it was eye opening to watch a movie that talks about these topics
            in such a profound way. The movie itself at face value is presented as really eccentric and bizarre, but the
            themes are what makes the movie so relevant to a viewer like me. This movie has many genres combined into
            one: romance, action, drama, yet it somehow ties all these elements together perfectly at the end. </p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is one of those movies you watch and come out of the theatre as a completely new person by the end of
            it. It made me think about the ways in which I view living and as well as my relationships with my family.
            Overall, this movie is a 10/10! </p>
